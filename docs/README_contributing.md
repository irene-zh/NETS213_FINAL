# NETS 213 Final Project 
### How to Contribute to this Project

If you're interested in contributing to this project, we'd love for you to do so! Here's a a step-by-step on how you can do so:

#### Step 1: Describe the poems.
We will post HITs that will ask the crowd (that's you!) to read a poem and come up with 3 keywords and a mood for it. You can access this task [here](https://worker.mturk.com).

#### Step 2: Write some poetry!
We will post HITs that will ask the crowd (that's you!) to write 3-4 lines of poetry given the first line of an original poem as inspiration, 3 keywords of the original poem, and the mood of the original poem. There will be 2 iterations for this step; you can access the current iteration of the task [here](https://worker.mturk.com).

#### Step 2.5: Quality Control on other people's poetry
We will post HITs that will ask the crowd (that's you!) to perform quality control on poetry that other members of the crowd have written (from Step 2). You will be given the first line of the original poem, 3 keywords of the original poem, and the mood of the original poem, as well as the crowdsourced poem so far. You will then determine if the crowdsourced poem is a valid poem. There will be 2 iterations for this step; you can access the current iteration of the task [here](https://worker.mturk.com).

#### Step 3: Evaluating crowdsourced poetry
After we are done with our crowdsourced poetry, we will then post HITs that will ask the crowd (that's you!) to evaluate our poetry! :) We will give you two poems and then ask you which you think is better (one will be the original poem, one will be a crowdsourced poem - of course, we won't tell you which is which).
