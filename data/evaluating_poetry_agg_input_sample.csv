INVITATION (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"If you are a dreamer, come in,","If you are a dreamer, come in,
Come in and dream,
Dream about the future,
About your wishes and hopes
Before the sidewalk ends."
INVITATION (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"If you are a dreamer, come in,","If you are a dreamer, come in,
where you can daydream freely.
This is an invitation
To wish for your goals
To walk the sidewalk
Before the dream ends."
