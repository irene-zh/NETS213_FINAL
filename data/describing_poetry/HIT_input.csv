INVITATION (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"If you are a dreamer, come in,<br>If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,<br>A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer…<br>If you’re a pretender, come sit by my fire<br>For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.<br>Come in!<br>Come in!"
"HOW MANY, HOW MUCH (A Light in the Attic)",How many slams in an old screen door?<br>Depends how loud you shut it.<br>How many slices in a bread?<br>Depends how thin you cut it.<br>How much good inside a day?<br>Depends how good you live ‘em.<br>How much love inside a friend?<br>Depends how much you give ‘em.
LISTEN TO THE MUSTN’TS (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"Listen to the MUSTN’TS, child,<br>Listen to the DON’TS<br>Listen to the SHOULDN’TS<br>The IMPOSSIBLES, the WON’TS<br>Listen to the NEVER HAVES<br>Then lost close to me—<br>Anything can happen, child,<br>ANYTHING can be."

PANCAKE? (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"Who wants a pancake,<br>Sweet and piping hot?<br>Good little Grace looks up and says,<br>“I’ll take the one on top.”<br>Who else wants a pancake,<br>Fresh off the griddle?<br>Terrible Theresa smiles and says,<br>“I’ll take the one in the middle.”"
SNOWBALL (Falling Up),"I made myself a snowball<br>As perfect as could be.<br>I thought I’d keep it as a pet<br>And let it sleep with me.<br>I made it some pajamas<br>And a pillow for its head.<br>  Then last night it ran away,<br>  But first—it wet the bed."
SOMETHING MISSING (A Light in the Attic),"I remember I put on my socks,<br>I remember I put on my shoes.<br>I remember I put on my tie<br>That was printed<br>In beautiful purples and blues.<br>I remember I put on my coat,<br>To look perfectly grand at the dance,<br>Yet I feel there is something<br>I may have forgot-<br>What is it? What is it?..."

I WON’T HATCH (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"Oh I am a chicken who lives in an egg,<br>But I will not hatch, I will not hatch.<br>The hens they all cackle, the roosters all beg,<br>But I will not hatch, I will not hatch.<br>For I hear all the talk of pollution and war<br>As the people all shout and the airplanes roar,<br>So I’m staying in here where it’s safe and it’s warm,<br>And I WILL NOT HATCH!"
PUT SOMETHING IN (A Light in the Attic),"Draw a crazy picture,<br>Write a nutty poem,<br>Sing a mumble-gumble song,<br>Whistle through your comb.<br>Do a loony-goony dance<br>‘Cross the kitchen floor,<br>Put something silly in the world<br>That ain’t been there before."
YESEES AND NOEES (Every Thing On It),"The Yesees said yes to anything<br>That anyone suggested.<br>The Noees said no to everything<br>Unless it was proven and tested.<br>So the Yesees all died of much too much<br>And the Noees all died of fright,<br>But somehow I think the Thinkforyourselfees<br>All came out all right."
HUG O’WAR (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"I will not play tug o’ war.<br>I’d rather play hug o’ war,<br>Where everyone hugs<br>Instead of tugs,<br>Where everyone giggles<br>And rolls on the rug,<br>Where everyone kisses,<br>And everyone grins,<br>And everyone cuddles,<br>And everyone wins."

COLORS (Where the Sidewalk Ends),"My skin is kind of sort of brownish<br>Pinkish yellowish white.<br>My eyes are grayish blueish green,<br>But I’m told they look orange in the night.<br>My hair is reddish blondish brown,<br>But it’s silver when it’s wet.<br>And all the colors I am inside<br>Have not been invented yet."

MORGAN’S CURSE (Falling Up),"Followin’ the trail on the old treasure map,<br>I came to the spot that said, “Dig right here.”<br>And four feet down my spade struck wood<br>Just where the map said a chest would appear.<br>But carved in the side were written these words:<br>“A curse upon he who disturbs this gold.”<br>Signed, Morgan the Pirate, Scourge of the Seas.<br>I read these words and my blood ran cold.<br>So here I set upon untold wealth<br>Tryin’ to figure which is worse:<br>How much do I need this gold?<br>And how much do I need this curse?"
