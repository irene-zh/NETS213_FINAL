HOW MANY, HOW MUCH (A Light in the Attic)
Rating: 10

How many slams in an old screen door?
Many friends come and go
That sound is something I adore
It means I'm love and exceedingly so
The door is a gateway to many happy times
Left open the love comes through to reach your heart
Friends smile down as you sit by it each day
It shows the groups of all who pcome and go as one watches time pass

As many times as we hear that sound.
How many ways can I love my friend.
You are always there for me.
When one door in my life closes.
You boost me up and make me happy.

To the planet of the Aces

WHO (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 10

Who can kick a football
We argued- I might, he might or maybe she
The policemen spotted us, there outside the mall
We picked the ball and quietly handed over the fee
But then we fought with all our might
(For paying a fine didn't feel free)
And In the clinker we spent the night
For kicking policemen in the knee!

FISH? (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 10

The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The big one eats the other two
Now the big fish is fat,
And grew and grew and grew.

And out came the fish, the tiny and little.
They couldn't believe it, freedom at last!
Then tiny was popped like a skittle.

As you stare at the man in the mirror

Their own team is declared a dud
Yet it never stops their grins

I met a dino who thought he is a rhino,
I met a clown who wanted to go down.
They all where creepy or even needy

IT‚ÄôS DARK IN HERE (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 3

I am writing these poems
From inside a lion,
And it's rather dark in here.
So please excuse the handwriting
It's very wet and dark inside
and the ink tends to smear
A lion is a great place to hide
if you can get over your fear

COMPLAININ‚Äô JACK (Falling Up)
Rating: 2

This morning my old jack-in-the-box
Was close to flipping it‚Äôs lid
I cranked him and cranked him
Until he thought he was on acid
Jack-in-the-box don't let me down
Pop open, pop open. What a surprise.
You are the best acid head around!
The best that ever crossed my eyes.

I never have nightmares,
I sleep during the DAY.
If I have a nightmare,
It's best to stay away.
I never have nightmares,
I sleep during the DAY.
If I have a nightmare,
It's best to stay away.

Who wants a pancake,

Sweet yummy pancakes
Buttery goodness in the pot.
Come all to eat your pancakes
The gridddle is now cool

I made an airplane out of stone‚Ä¶
I used a chisel
and tried not to break a bone
so my mom would be happy at home.
I have and airplane made of stone

Mom stays happy and we meet for lunch

I tripped on my shoelace
and the aglet ripped

before I get sick
I packed my suitcase
I didn't get sick,
but I tripped again on my shoelace
is someone playing a trick?

MAGIC (Where the Sidewalk Ends)

Sandra‚Äôs seen a leprechaun,
it was short and fat
hey little girl have you seen my pot of gold
o
running along with fawn
down the hill they all roll
what magic will dawn
when Sandra meets the jolly old troll
