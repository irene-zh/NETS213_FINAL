There’s a light on in the attic.<br><br>
I can see it from the outside,<br><br>
And I know you’re on the inside… lookin’ out.<br><br>",There‚Äôs a light on in the attic.,where the dark shadows cast sparkles into the abyss,inside the doves take flight and the squirrel's delight with behaviour that is dramatic,if only to mark the time between the morning's first dew and the evenings short but sweet indigo kiss,i have a thought it was dark still and dry,sometimes i wonder when will it change till morning or the next,come by and see the mood is quite at times,all of the time
