Is not flat at all, but more like a grape
And its edge only astronauts are able to see
Oh how interesting that visit must be!

MY ZOOOTCH (Every Thing On It)
Rating: 5

I never have nightmares,
Though some folks have nightmares every night.
Instead I have nightstallions
And that makes things all right.
My mom has so many nightmares
I can't say that I have
But I know that she's had too many affairs
Never have I ever been one to enslave

OURCHESTRA (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 5

So you haven‚Äôt got a drum, just beat your belly.
Stay in rhythm, don't move too late or too early
let's do an acapella, no instruments
or better yet, let's make sweet music with brass instruments
Mighty ships run aground at her horrible sound,
pretty pictures fall out of their frames,
trees drop off their branches,
rocks start avalanches,

Never as I sleep.

NOPE (Falling Up)
Rating: 4

I put a piece of cantaloupe
Where you might ask?
It was no small feat
I shoved it into the microscope real neat!
Nope, it is in the table
I can eat it piece by piece
It is so sweet like honey
It is so delicious

FISH? (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 3

The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The big snake eats the huge snake,
The fat will eat the tiny.
the big will eat the fat
and the little are no more
the fat just left
and the big keeps eating

HOW MANY, HOW MUCH (A Light in the Attic)
Rating: 3

How many slams in an old screen door?
I ask you now, my friend
Does the noise ever end
Every time you slam the door.
That old wooden door
slams loud with a gust of wind
I love the wind and that old door
so slam it loud once again.

RIDICULOUS ROSE (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 2

Her mama said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat with your fingers.‚Äù
"Would you rather I eat with my toes?" She said with a laugh
"You are so silly" said mama in reply
"Or how about this nice red rose?" She said pointing to the vase on the table
Oh, if you're a bird, be an early bird
And catch the worm for your breakfast plate
And catch the worm for your breakfast plate
But if you're a worm s

The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The big snake eats the huge snake,
The fat will eat the tiny.
Tiny and little must become big
Else they lay low and stay hid
jiggly jiggly big fat belly
Tiny can get trapped if they're not ready!

HOW NOT TO HAVE TO DRY THE DISHES (Falling Up)
Rating: 2

If you have to dry the dishes
don't think of it as a chore,
just drop it in the dishwasaher
and it'll keep drying it some more
Remember not to drop the dishes
unto the floor
You would have to pick up the pieces
which is quite a chore

I MUST REMEMBER (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 2

I must remember‚Ä¶
Lily performed a dunce dance
She must do it like a yoga
But she remembered that she should dance a dunce dance
but alas! I am no dunce!
and remember I must
with a great thrust
I went on to dance

YEARS FROM NOW (Every Thing On It)
Rating: 2

Although I cannot see your face
I still imagine your clown smile
I know your not laughing at all
But your looks makes me laugh
I'm feeling light at the moment,
Small as can be-the sky-all I view,
And I'm just reeling,
High up in the clouds-a message in blue,

WARNING (Where the Sidewalk Ends)
Rating: 1

Inside everybody‚Äôs nose
sometimes a green booger grows
everyone has a sharp tooth bite
with tooth and nails  sometimes we fight
The bigger the booger gets
the more likely it in the nail or tooth sets
And no matter how sharp-toothed you are
it's unlikely that your booger fight will go far.

I met a ghost, but he didn‚Äôt want my head,
He want devil in my head
and vampire in my mind
Happy to see such a funny ghost,who didn't want my head
