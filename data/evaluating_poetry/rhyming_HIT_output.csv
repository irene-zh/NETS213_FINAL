Even though it is shorter, the grammar and spelling are all correct, and the irony is that the writer does not have nightmares because the Zoootch ( I am assuming a monster) keeps them away. The second poem is good as well, and I appreciated the writer's effort to make the 1st and 3rd lines rhyme as well as the 2nd and 4rth lines. I gave it a lower rating for 2 reasons: grammar and spelling was not as good as the first, and the second reason is that the poem is a little tough to read. I mean, the reader has to time the words just right to get them to rhyme because some sentences are short, while the others are longer. Both are good poems though."
